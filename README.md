# cpp_learning_note
This is a repository of my personal notes and codes about C++, including topics about basic syntax, templates, concurrency, and smart pointers.

This is not a textbook, please do not think there is no problem or mistake in it, so be careful and cautious when reading it, and don't forget to refer to the CPP REFERENCE website.

The codes and comments are all written before I become an undergraduate, and originally are only for my personal use. So the comments are all written in Chinese (with a small part in English).

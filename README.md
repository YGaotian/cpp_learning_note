# cpp_learning_note
This is a repository of my personal notes and codes about C++, including topics about basic syntax, templates, concurrency, and smart pointers.

This is not a textbook, please do not think there is no problem or mistake in it, so be careful and cautious when reading it, and don't forget to refer to the CPP REFERENCE website.

The codes and comments were all written after I graduated from senior high school, and originally were for personal use only. So the comments were all written in Chinese (with a small part of them in English). Since English is not my native language, you may find some grammatical problems. I hope you won't mind them, and can still understand what I mean.

The main() is in this file: "main_learning.cpp".
